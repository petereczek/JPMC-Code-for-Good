On July 28th, our beloved son CJ found eternal rest. He is at peace, but we are shattered.
CJ was many things - a loving son and grandson, a fiercely protective brother, a caring, chivalrous boyfriend, and a loyal friend. He was a charmer with a big bright spirit and an out of the box approach to life. He had a deep love of music and was a talented musician, an all around athlete, and a valued team member. He lit up every room he entered and uplifted his teammates and coworkers with his sly smile and quick wit. He had a bright future.
He also suffered from addiction - a horrible, insidious disease that he fought bravely, but it stole him from us. Our only solace is knowing he is at peace and we pray that we may find it again someday soon.
Rest In Peace Boombie- you are loved and missed beyond measure."/>
                <MessageBox engagements="632"imgString="images/rj_small.jpg" title="RJ Small" caption="I remember the day my brother was born. I was almost done with kindergarten and wore a pin with his picture on it so everyone that saw me knew I was now a big sister.
The age difference was tough during the earlier years but we were always each others biggest fans. I loved watching him play basketball and rarely missed a game and he was a dedicated softball fan through my entire playing career.
As we got older and life started to take its twists and turns, RJ started to have a harder time overcoming the many obstacles life threw his way.
He craved love, normalcy, and stability but was often faced with chaos and hardships.
He blessed our family with an amazing baby girl and we thought that might turn things around for him but instead, the harder he tried to find those things he was looking for, the more difficult life got for him.
He never saw himself the way that everyone else did: handsome, funny, smart, outgoing.
If love could have saved him, he would have lived forever but he could never truly find the love for himself in his heart.
We miss him every single day."/>
